| Git task | Notes | Git commands |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **[Tell Git who you are](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-config)** | Configure the author name and email address to be used with your commits.Note that Git [strips some characters](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26159274/is-it-possible-to-have-a-trailing-period-in-user-name-in-git/26219423#26219423)(for example trailing periods) from `user.name`. | `git config --global user.name "Sam Smith"` <br> `git config --global user.email sam@example.com` <br/>|
| **[Create a new local repository](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-init)** |  | ``` git init ```  |
| **[Check out a repository](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-clone)** | Create a working copy of a local repository: |`git clone /path/to/repository`|
|| For a remote server, use: | `git clone username@host:/path/to/repository`|
| **[Add files](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes#git-add)** | Add single file to staging (index): | `git add <filename>` |
|| Add one or more files to staging (index):| `git add *`|
| **[Commit](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes#git-commit)** | Commit changes to head (but not yet to the remote repository): |`git commit -m "Commit message"`|
|| Commit any files you've added with `git add`, and also commit any files you've changed since then: |`git commit -a`|
| **[Push](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing#git-push)** | Send changes to the master branch of your remote repository: |`git push origin master`|
| **[Status](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/inspecting-a-repository#git-status)** | List the files you've changed and those you still need to add or commit: |`git status`|
| **[Connect to a remote repository](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing#git-remote)** | If you haven't connected your local repository to a remote server, add the server to be able to push to it: | `git remote add origin <server>` |
|| List all currently configured remote repositories: | `git remote -v` |
| **[Branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches)** | Create a new branch and switch to it: | `git checkout -b <branchname>`|
|| Switch from one branch to another: | `git checkout <branchname>` |
|| List all the branches in your repo, and also tell you what branch you're currently in: |`git branch`|
|| Delete the feature branch: | `git branch -d <branchname>`|
|| Push the branch to your remote repository, so others can use it: | `git push origin <branchname>` |
| |Push all branches to your remote repository: |`git push --all origin`|
|| Delete a branch on your remote repository: | `git push origin :<branchname>` |
| **[Update from the remote repository](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing)** | Fetch and merge changes on the remote server to your working directory: | `git pull` |
|| To merge a different branch into your active branch: | `git merge <branchname>` |
|| View all the merge conflicts:View the conflicts against the base file:Preview changes, before merging: | `git diff` , `git diff --base <filename>`, `git diff <sourcebranch> <targetbranch&>` |
|| After you have manually resolved any conflicts, you mark the changed file: | `git add <filename>`|
| **Tags** | You can use tagging to mark a significant changeset, such as a release: |`git tag 1.0.0 &lt;commitID&gt;` |
|| CommitId is the leading characters of the changeset ID, up to 10, but must be unique. Get the ID using: |`git log`  |
|| Push all tags to remote repository: |`git push --tags origin`  |
| **[Undo local changes](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes)** | If you mess up, you can replace the changes in your working tree with the last content in head:Changes already added to the index, as well as new files, will be kept. | `git checkout -- <filename>` |
|| Instead, to drop all your local changes and commits, fetch the latest history from the server and point your local master branch at it, do this: |`git fetch origin`` git reset --hard origin/master`|
| **Search** | Search the working directory for `foo()`: | `git grep "foo()"` |
